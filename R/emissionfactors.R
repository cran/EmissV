#' @description Return a data frame with vehicle information. Types argument defines the diary use:
#'
#' @format data frame
#'
#' @param ef list with emission factors
#' @param poluttant poluttant names
#' @param vnames name of each vehicle categoy (optional)
#' @param unit tring with unit from unit package, for default is "g/km"
#' @param example TRUE to diaplay a simple example
#' @param verbose display additional information
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{areaSource}} and  \code{\link{totalEmission}}
