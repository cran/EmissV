\details{
- Profiles 1 to 2 are from traffic count at São Paulo city from Perez Martínez et al (2014).

- Profiles 3 to 25 comes from traffic counted of toll stations located in São Paulo city,
for summer and winters of 2012, 2013 and 2014.

- Profiles 26 to 33 are for different sectors from Oliver et al (2003).

- Profiles 34 to 36 are for volumetric mechanized traffic count at Janio Quadros tunnel on November 2018.

- Profiles 37 to 38 are for volumetric mechanized traffic count at Anhanguera-Castello Branco on October 2018.

\note{
The profile is normalized by days (but is balanced for a complete week) it means
diary_emission x profile = hourly_emission.
